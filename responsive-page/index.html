                order.<br>
                If you feel overwhelmed, that is normal. Programming is hard.<br>
                Practice is the key. Practice, practice, practice.<br>
                And this curriculum will give you thousands of hours of hands-on programming practice.<br>
                Where can I get technical support for using the freeCodeCamp.org platform?
                Here are answers to common technical support questions.

                What is freeCodeCamp?
                freeCodeCamp is a community of millions of people around the world who are learning to code
                together.<br> You can learn to code with free online courses, programming projects, and interview
                preparation for developer jobs. We're a 501(c)(3) public charity.

                How can you help me learn to code?
                You'll learn to code by completing coding challenges and building projects. You'll also earn verified

                            This course is designed as a one-semester college course. It consists of instructional
                            videos, with Google Colaboratory notebooks to follow along interactively, assignments, and
                            challenging projects.
                            As you go through each part of this course in sequence, you will gain a full understanding
                            of Algebra and how to write Python code to solve Algebra problems.
                            Throughout this course, you will also build your own Algebra Colab notebook that you will be
                            able to use as your custom calculator.
                            This course (and the code you write here) will give you the foundation for a deeper math and
                            data science understanding.</p>

                    <div class="para3_1">
                        <p>As your programs or web applications become more complex, you'll
                            want to test them to make sure that new changes don't break their original
                            functionality.
                            In the Quality Assurance Certification, you'll learn how to write tests with Chai to
                            ensure your applications work the way you expect them t
                            Then you'll build a chat application to learn advanced Node and Express concepts. You'll
                            also use Pug as a template engine, Passport for authentication, and Socket.io for
                            real-time communication between the server and connected clients.
                            Chai is a JavaScript testing library that helps you confirm that your program still
                            behaves the way you expect it to after you make changes to your code.
                            Using Chai, you can write tests that describe your program's requirements and see if
                            your program meets them
                            In this course, you'll learn about assertions, deep equality, truthiness, testing APIs,
                            and other fundamentals for testing JavaScript applications.</p>

                        <p>For these courses, you will use real developer tools and software including VS Code,
                            PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build
                            projects.
                            These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, you will learn
                            everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to
                            advanced usage.
                            Next, you will learn how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database
                            management system, and SQL, the language of these databases.
                            Finally, you will learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every
                            developer.</p>

                            how to write back end apps with Node.js and npm. You'll also build web applications with
                            the Express framework, and build a People Finder microservice with MongoDB and the
                            Mongoose library.npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create,
                            and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. There are many open source
                            packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so
                            you don't end up recreating the wheel for
                            things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.
                            In this course, you'll learn the basics of using npm, including how to work with the
                            package.json and how to manage your installed dependencies.

                        With the Information Security Certification, you'll build a secure web app with HelmetJS to
                        learn the fundamentals of protecting people's information online
                        You'll also build a TCP client, and an Nmap and port scanner in Python. This will help you
                        learn the basics of penetration testing — an important component of good information
                        security.
                        This programming course focuses on HelmetJS, a type of middleware for Express-based
                        applications that automatically sets HTTP headers. This way it can prevent sensitive
                        information
                        from unintentionally being passed between the server and client.
